## ðŸ’¡ Abstract
BloomMate is an application designed to assist people in cultivating plants using Tiiun in LG's SmartCottage. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a significant increase in home gardening, resulting in a growing market. To address this trend, BloomMate was created as a solution to the lack of applications that provide professional plant growth assistance. Many people face difficulties such as plant diseases or deaths due to the complexity of plant cultivation.

BloomMate offers key features in four categories:

1. Plant log management: Users can manage logs throughout the entire planting and harvesting process.
2. Easy plant cultivation: Detailed plant information, expert articles, Q&A, and AI plant diagnosis are provided to help users grow plants easily.
3. Enjoyable plant cultivation: Users can engage in chat functionality with an AI trained on the plants they are growing.
4. Guide appropriate user actions: AI provides customized information and encourages specific actions, such as one-click purchases.

These features aim to alleviate the difficulties users encounter when cultivating plants.

BloomMate consists of four modules: Frontend, Backend, Machine Learning, and Static Data Storage. All modules, except for Static Data Storage, were developed by team members and can be found on Github. The overall architecture follows the MVC pattern, and the Machine Learning module uses the resnet-50 model, which has been converted into a TensorFlow Lite model.

Currently, BloomMate can be downloaded as an APK file for Android via Google Drive. We are confident that BloomMate will enhance the gardening experience with Tiiun in LG's SmartCottage.

## ðŸ’¡ Target Users
The target users of BloomMate are individuals who use SmartCottage's outdoor garden Tiiun. These users face the following issues:

BloomMate offers suitable solutions for each of these pain points, including features such as plant chatting, plant diagnosis, Q&A, expert articles, and more.

## ðŸ’¡ Abstract
BloomMate is an application designed to assist people in growing plants using Tiiun in LG's SmartCottage. In South Korea, there has been a growing trend of home gardening, particularly among retirees in rural areas, since 2023. However, there has been a lack of applications that provide professional assistance for growing plants to match this trend. Additionally, many people face difficulties when attempting to grow plants, such as plant diseases or frequent plant deaths due to the high level of difficulty. BloomMate was created to address these issues.

BloomMate offers four key features:

1. Plant Log Management: Users can manage logs throughout the process of planting and harvesting plants.
2. Easy Plant Growing: Information on plant details, expert articles, Q&A, and AI plant diagnosis are provided to help users easily grow plants.
3. Enjoyable Plant Growing: Users can engage in chat conversations with a generative AI trained on their own plants.
4. Guiding Appropriate User Actions: Personalized information and specific actions are induced using generative AI.

These features are expected to alleviate many of the difficulties users encounter when growing plants.

BloomMate consists of four modules: Frontend, Backend, Machine Learning, and Static Data Storage. The team members have developed all modules except for Static Data Storage, and the source code can be found on Github. The overall architecture follows the MVC pattern, and the Machine Learning module utilizes the resnet-50 model, which has been converted into a TensorFlow Lite model.

Currently, the APK file for Android can be downloaded through Google Drive. We are confident that BloomMate will be a helpful tool in enjoying a pleasant gardening experience at SmartCottage with Tiiun from LG.
